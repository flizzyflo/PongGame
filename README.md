## Pong in Python

I implemtend a pong game. Therefore, I tried to take care of OOP. Furthermore, there are already the foundations for implementing obstacles or other things like a 2 player mode e.g. 
However, the code is working and one is able to play the game, count the score and have fun.

Enjoy!
